# Editor Buddy

This package is a CLI and web tool for use by editors of written documents. While editing manuscripts, essays, and other types of prose, editors can use Editor Buddy to rapidly perform data entry of observations they make while reading. Things that an editor might observe include typos, awkward sentences, missing words, comma splices, run-ons, and [widows and orphans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans).

Editor Buddy also offers a web interface through which the editor can share his observations with the author who produced the manuscript. If the client for whom I'm building this is interested, I will also add web functionality for author, such as checking a box to indicate that he has addressed an observation, or giving feedback and instructions (for example, telling the editor to ignore something in the future, and not consider it an error.)
